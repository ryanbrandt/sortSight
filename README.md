# sortSight

SortSight is a little web application I made to help CS students understand
algorithm (particularly sorting algorithm) complexity!

I made this application very quickly to learn JSP, JDBC and MySQL for a large project I will be undertaking with this stack.

## Features

Allows users to test out fundamental sorting algorithms, which I manually implemented and optimized, with various sizes of input to visualize algorithmic complexity in real-time.

The application collects the data from these sorting trials and provides users with some summary statistics regarding the different methods for different sizes of input and some visuals so users can better understand the asymptotic behavior of the different algorithms.

(TODO) Provides users with pseudo-code and complexity derivation of the sorting algorithms.

(TODO) Deploy with AWS RDS and Elastic Beanstalk
## Tech

1. Java/JSP/JDBC
2. HTML/CSS/JavaScript
3. MySQL
